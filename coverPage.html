               <strong>Overview</strong> <br/>
                <p>
                    Robotics have long captured the human imagination. Despite the advances in the area, robots have yet to 
                    reach high intelligence.Robotics with minimal intelligence are already invading our homes, such as vacuum cleaners,
                    automatic lawn mowers, toy robots,and even robot dogs.Throughout history, robots have embodied and exemplified cutting-edge 
                    technology and going forward scientist are working towards developing future generations of highly intelligent robots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technology is crucial part in the building of robots. The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and applications
                    that computer systems use for control. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take place of humans in dangerous enviornments or process 
                    that resembele humans.As of now, Robots are now being used to preform repetitive and dangerous tasks that humans prefer not to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Robots can be useful, since it takes the place of dangerous tasks that humans don't want to accomplish as well as make the life of humans easier.
                   It can open up thousands of jobs as well as innovating new techology.
