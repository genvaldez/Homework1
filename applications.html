            <div class="centered"> There are many different robots that are being created. It is said that robots will one day rule the world, that is a belief humans are very afaraid of which is the reason 
            why robots is something that is unspoken of.The reality is that the 'Robots' already exist and are in our homes such as vacumes and your typical electronics. There is also those 
            robots that are revolutionizing the tech field.There are Space Robots that deals with the development of intelligent robots for extraterrestrial exploration. These robots can accomplish 
            tasks ranging from in-situ examinations to the organisation and maintenance of infrastructure and Reconfigurable systems for planetary exploration.here are also Underwater Robots that deals 
            with the development and realization of Artificial Intelligence methods in underwater systems. This robot deals with systems for user 
            support in remote-controlled underwater vehicles employing virtual immersion methods. The Design of methods for autonomous manipulation and mission planning of robot arms in underwater 
            applications, particularly with state-of-the-art sensor technology, such as "Visual Servoing".
            Search and rescue robots will soon be developed to support rescue and security personnel.
